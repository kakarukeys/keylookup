boilerplate
===========

A simple angular.js app to illustrate the use of
*   ng-controller
*   ng-repeat
*   ng-model
*   ng-change
*   ng-click
*   ng-bind
*   $scope

Note that the data can be served using a RESTful backend. This app also uses twitter bootstrap and underscore.js. The whole app was finished within a day.
